# wt_cli

`wt_cli` is a command line interface to interact with the Eye of Satoshi watchtower, written in Python3.

## Dependencies
Refer to [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md)

## Installation

Refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

## Usage

	python wt_cli.py [global options] command [command options] [arguments]
	
#### Global options

- `-s, --server`:	API server where to send the requests. Defaults to https://teos.pisa.watch (modifiable in conf.py)
- `-p, --port` :	API port where to send the requests. Defaults to 443 (modifiable in conf.py)
- `-h --help`: 	shows a list of commands or help for a specific command.

#### Commands

The command line interface has, currently, three commands:

- `add_appointment`: registers a json formatted appointment to the tower.
- `get_appointment`: gets json formatted data about an appointment from the tower.
- `help`: shows a list of commands or help for a specific command.

### add_appointment

This command is used to register appointments to the watchtower. Appointments **must** be `json` encoded, and match the following format:

	{ "tx": tx,
	  "tx_id": tx_id,
	  "start_time": s,
	  "end_time": e,
	  "to_self_delay": d }
	
`tx` **must** be the raw penalty transaction that will be encrypted before sent to the watchtower. `type(tx) = hex encoded str`

`tx_id` **must** match the **commitment transaction id**, and will be used to encrypt the **penalty transaction** and **generate the locator**. `type(tx_id) = hex encoded str`

`s` is the time when the watchtower will start watching your transaction, and will normally match to whenever you will be offline. `s` is measured in block height, and must be **higher than the current block height**. `type(s) = int`

`e` is the time where the watchtower will stop watching your transaction, and will normally match with whenever you should be back online. `e` is also measured in block height, and must be **higher than** `s`. `type(e) = int`

`d` is the time the watchtower would have to respond with the **penalty transaction** once the **dispute transaction** is seen in the blockchain. `d` must match with the `OP_CSV` specified in the dispute transaction. If the to\_self\_delay does not match the `OP_CSV`, the watchtower will try to respond with the penalty transaction anyway, but success is not guaranteed. `d` is measured in blocks and should be at least `20`. `type(d) = int`

The API will return a `application/json` HTTP response code `200/OK` if the appointment is accepted, with the locator encoded in the response text, or a `400/Bad Request` if the appointment is rejected, with the rejection reason encoded in the response text. 

### Alpha release restrictions
The alpha release does not have authentication, payments nor rate limiting, therefore some self imposed restrictions apply:

- `start_time` should be within the next 6 blocks `[current_time+1, current_time+6]`.
- `end_time` cannot be bigger than (roughly) a month. That is `4320` blocks on top of `start_time`.
- `encrypted_blob`s are limited to `2 kib`.


#### Usage

	python wt_cli.py add_appointment [command options] <appointment>/<path_to_appointment_file>
	
if `-f, --file` **is** specified, then the command expects a path to a json file instead of a json encoded string as parameter.
	
#### Options
- `-f, --file path_to_json_file`	 loads the appointment data from the specified json file instead of command line.

### get_appointment	

 This command is used to get information about an specific appointment from the Eye of Satoshi.	

**Appointment can be in three states:**

- `not_found`: meaning the locator is not recognised by the tower. This can either mean the locator is wrong, or the appointment has already been fulfilled (the tower does not keep track of completed appointments for now).
- `being_watched`: the appointment has been accepted by the tower and it's being watched at the moment. This stage means that the dispute transaction has not been seen yet, and therefore no penalty transaction has been broadcast.
- `dispute_responded`: the dispute was found by the watcher and the corresponding penalty transaction has been broadcast by the node. In this stage the tower is actively monitoring until the penalty transaction reaches enough confirmations and making sure no fork occurs in the meantime.

**Response formats**

**not_found**

	[{"locator": appointment_locator, 
	"status":"not_found"}]
	
**being_watched**

	[{"encrypted_blob": eb,
	"end_time": e,
	"locator": appointment_locator,
	"start_time": s,
	"status": "being_watched",
	"to_self_delay": d}]
	
**dispute_responded**

	[{"appointment_end": e,
	"dispute_txid": dispute_txid,
	"locator": appointment_locator,
	"penalty_rawtx": penalty_rawtx,
	"penalty_txid": penalty_txid,
	"status": "dispute_responded"}]
	
#### Usage

	python wt_cli.py get_appointment <appointment_locator>
	

	
### help

Shows the list of commands or help about how to run a specific command.

#### Usage
	python wt_cli.py help
	
or

	python wt_cli.py help command

## Example

1. Generate a new dummy appointment. **Note:** this appointment will never be fulfilled (it will eventually expire) since it does not corresopond to a valid transaction. However it can be used to interact with the Eye of Satoshi's API.

    ```
	echo '{"tx": "4615a58815475ab8145b6bb90b1268a0dbb02e344ddd483f45052bec1f15b1951c1ee7f070a0993da395a5ee92ea3a1c184b5ffdb2507164bf1f8c1364155d48bdbc882eee0868ca69864a807f213f538990ad16f56d7dfb28a18e69e3f31ae9adad229e3244073b7d643b4597ec88bf247b9f73f301b0f25ae8207b02b7709c271da98af19f1db276ac48ba64f099644af1ae2c90edb7def5e8589a1bb17cc72ac42ecf07dd29cff91823938fd0d772c2c92b7ab050f8837efd46197c9b2b3f", "tx_id": "0b9510d92a50c1d67c6f7fc5d47908d96b3eccdea093d89bcbaf05bcfebdd951", "start_time": 0, "end_time": 0, "to_self_delay": 20}' > dummy_appointment_data.json
    ```

    That will create a json file that follows the appointment data structure filled with dummy data and store it in `dummy_appointment_data.json`. **Note**: You'll need to update the `start_time` and `end_time` to match valid block heights.

2. Send the appointment to the tower API. Which will then start monitoring for matching transactions.

    ```
    python wt_cli.py add_appointment -f dummy_appointment_data.json
    ```

    This returns a appointment locator that can be used to get updates about this appointment from the tower.

3. Test that the tower is still watching the appointment by replacing the appointment locator received into the following command:

    ```
    python wt_cli.py get_appointment <appointment_locator>
    ```

## the Eye of Satoshi's API	

If you wish to read about the underlying API, and how to write your own tool to interact with it, refer to [tEOS-API.md](tEOS-API.md).

## Are you reckless? Try me on mainnet
Would you like to try me on `mainnet` instead of `testnet`? Add `-s https://mainnet.teos.pisa.watch` to your calls, for example:

```
python wt_cli.py -s https://teosmainnet.pisa.watch add_appointment -f dummy_appointment_data.json 
```

You can also change the config file to avoid specifying the server every time:

`DEFAULT_PISA_API_SERVER = "https://teosmainnet.pisa.watch"`
